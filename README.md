# NumberPrediction
Using Tensorflow.js to machine learn a pattern from 6 inputs that user keys in user. Then the user give a new number to get the prodiction from the learnt model.

## What I learnt
* async/await for model training, in tensorflow.js
* tensorflow.js basic framework.
* saving and loading tensorflow models to localstorage://
* vanilla JS to hide/show html content.
