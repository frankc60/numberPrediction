# NumberPrediction
Using Tensorflow.js to machine learn a pattern from the user's 6 inputs. Then using the model, predict a result from another user input, using the pattern learnt.

## What I learnt
* async/await for model training, in tensorflow.js
* tensorflow.js basic framework.
* saving and loading tensorflow models to localstorage://
* vanilla JS to hide/show html content.
